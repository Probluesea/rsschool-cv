## Briefly about me
> I am a novice JavaScript developer who really wants to make my first website.
> I have experience with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL, but I have never programmed in JavaScript.
> My knowledge is very limited. I would like to learn how to create my own website, and how to use JavaScript to create them.
